## Team Members

- **[Ethan Murphy](https://github.com/emurphy04)** - Lead Developer for Java-Console Based E-Commerce Platform
- **[Brenda Armstrong](https://github.com/brendaleearmstrong)** - Lead Developer for VinoVault Wine Search Engine

## Overview

In the final sprint of Semester 3, our team, consisting of just two developers—Ethan Murphy and Brenda Armstrong—successfully delivered two comprehensive projects: the **Java-Console Based E-Commerce Platform** and the **VinoVault Wine Search Engine**. Despite being a smaller team compared to the standard group size of three, we managed to handle all aspects of project development, from planning to execution and deployment.

### Sprint Management and Branching Strategy

Managing the sprint as a two-person team required efficient collaboration and clear communication. To keep our codebases organized and our workflows efficient, we employed a branching strategy tailored to our needs:

#### Java-Console Based E-Commerce Platform (Ethan Murphy's Project)

- **Repository**: [SD10-S3-SPRINT-2-JAVA](https://github.com/emurphy04/SD10-S3-SPRINT-2-JAVA)
- **Branching Strategy**:
  - The **main branch** (`main`) served as the stable branch where the final code was consolidated.
  - Feature development was done on separate branches named after the specific feature being worked on (e.g., `feature/login`, `feature/search`).
  - Once a feature was completed and tested, it was merged into the `main` branch via pull requests to ensure that the integration was smooth and that the codebase remained stable.

#### VinoVault Wine Search Engine (Brenda Armstrong's Project)

- **Repository**: [S3-fsjs-finalsprint-vinovault](https://github.com/brendaleearmstrong/S3-fsjs-finalsprint-vinovault)
- **Branching Strategy**:
  - The **main branch** (`main`) was used as the stable branch that reflected the most up-to-date and tested version of the project.
  - New features and bug fixes were developed on separate branches (e.g., `feature/authentication`, `feature/search`).
  - Upon completion and testing, these feature branches were merged back into the `main` branch via pull requests, ensuring that only stable and fully reviewed code was included.

### Conclusion

Despite the challenges of working in a smaller team, we were able to successfully manage and deliver two high-quality projects by leveraging effective sprint management and a robust branching strategy. The experience gained from this sprint has significantly enhanced our skills in full-stack development, project management, and teamwork, preparing us for future professional challenges.
